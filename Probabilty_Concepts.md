#### Probability Properties

- A fundamental property of probability is that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes must equal 1 (or 100%).

##### Example:
For a die roll:
- Possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Each with probability: 1/6
- Sum: \(1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 6/6 = 1\)
